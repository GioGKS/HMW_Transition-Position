        <address>CHEETAH</address>
        <br />
        Fastest mammal on land, the cheetah can reach speeds of 60 or perhaps
        even 70 miles (97 or 113 kilometers) an hour over short distances. It
        usually chases its prey at only about half that speed, however. After a
        chase, a cheetah needs half an hour to catch its breath before it can
        eat. These cats are nimble at high speeds, able to make quick and sudden
        turns in pursuit of prey. Cheetahs’ bodies are uniquely adapted to help
        them reach top speeds, from their long, slender limbs and hard foot pads
        to the flexible spine that gives them their long stride.

        <address>ADELIE PENGUIN</address>
        <br />
        Adélie penguins breed and raise their young on the continent of
        Antarctica. In September and October—springtime in that part of the
        world—thousands of Adélies gather on the rocky Antarctic shoreline. The
        huge gatherings are called colonies.Adélie penguins build nests by
        scooping out areas in the ground. The female usually lays two eggs in
        the nest. Adélie penguin eggs hatch in December. In the Antarctic
        winter, the Adélie penguins live at sea. Both parents care for the eggs.
        While one stays behind keeping the eggs warm and safe from predators,
        the other parent heads out to sea to eat. They feast mainly on krill,
        tiny shrimplike animals, but also eat fish and squid.

        <address>GREAT WHITE SHARK</address>
        <br />
        When a great white shark is born, along with up to a dozen siblings, it
        immediately swims away from its mother. Born on the east and west coasts
        of North America, the south of Africa and southwest Australia, baby
        sharks are on their own right from the start. Their mother may see them
        only as prey.At birth a baby great white shark is already about 5 feet
        (1.5 meters) long; as it grows it may reach a length up to four times
        that. The pup (which is what a baby shark is called) will live its life
        at the top of the ocean's food chain. But before it grows larger, the
        pup must avoid predators bigger than it is—including other great white
        sharks. Many baby sharks do not survive their first year. Young great
        white sharks eat fish (including other sharks) and rays. As they grow,
        the sharks’ favorite prey becomes sea mammals, especially sea lions and
        seals.

        <address>CHAMELEON</address>
        <br />
        A chameleon sits motionlessly on a tree branch. Suddenly its sticky,
        two-foot-long tongue snaps out at 13 miles an hour, wrapping around a
        cricket and whipping the yummy snack back into the reptile’s mouth. Now
        that’s fast food dining! And the chameleon’s swift eating style is just
        one of its many features that’ll leave you tongue-tied.Chameleons mostly
        live in the rain forests and deserts of Africa. The color of their skin
        helps them blend in with their habitats. Chameleons that hang out in
        trees are usually green. Those that live in deserts are most often
        brown. They often change color to warm up or cool down. (Turning darker
        helps warm the animals because the dark colors absorb more heat.) They
        also switch shades to communicate with other chameleons, using bright
        colors to attract potential mates or warn enemies.
